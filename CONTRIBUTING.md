## Issue-First Workflow

**No PR without an issue. No exceptions.**

This project follows a strict issue-first workflow:

1. **Open an issue** using the appropriate template ([Bug Report](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) or [Feature Request](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml))
2. **Wait for approval** — a maintainer will add the `status:approved` label when the issue is ready to be worked on
3. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
4. **Open a PR** referencing the approved issue

PRs that are not linked to an approved issue will be **automatically rejected** by CI.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker (for E2E tests)
- Git

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai.git
cd gentle-ai
go build -o gga .
```

### Run Locally

```bash
./gga
```

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the full unit test suite:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests for a specific package:

```bash
go test ./internal/tui/...
```

Run with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### E2E Tests

E2E tests are Docker-based shell scripts. Docker must be running.

```bash
cd e2e
chmod +x docker-test.sh
./docker-test.sh
```

> ⚠️ E2E tests spin up containers to simulate real installation environments. They may take a few minutes to complete.

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:
